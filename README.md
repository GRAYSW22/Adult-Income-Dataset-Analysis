# Adult Income Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Adult Income Dataset using Python. The analysis is performed using a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

## Data Download
- **Dataset URL**: [Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/)
- **Dataset Description and Variables**: [Dataset Details](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names)
  - The data is downloaded as a CSV file on the disk for ease of use. However, it is recommended to practice data download on your own to familiarize with the process.

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
